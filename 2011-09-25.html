<h1>Tokyo</h1>
<p>Today we went to Yoyogi park with Rekha (stays in room 403; from Banglore)
and her friend. Part of the park is thickly wooded (in the middle of Tokyo) 
and has a shrine in it.</p>

<p>The other part is a sort of picnic spot for hundreds and hundreds of people. 
There are a whole bunch of people practicing hoola-hoop, juggling, 
tricks with a football, band practice (lot of jazzy sounding stuff)
walking the dog or just having a picnic and drinking a beer.
We went to an indian fete(Interestingly my stomache was upset when I got home); 
there were japanese girls bollywood-dancing in Saris.
Went to Takeshita Street (Tokyo&#39;s Fashion street).</p>

<p>Did the laundry or the first time.</p>
