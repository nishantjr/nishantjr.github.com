Part of the park is thickly wooded (in the middle of Tokyo) and has a shrine in it.</p> <p>The other part is a sort of picnic spot for hundreds and hundreds of people. There are a whole bunch of people practicing hoola-hoop, juggling, tricks with a football, band practice (lot of jazzy sounding stuff) walking the dog or just having a picnic and drinking a beer. We went to an indian fete(Interestingly my stomache was upset when I got home); there were japanese girls bollywood-dancing in Saris. Went to Takeshita Street (Tokyo's Fashion street).</p> <p>Did the laundry or the first time.</p> <div class="fb-comments" data-href="nishantjr.github.com/2011-09-25.html"></div> </div> <ul id='side-bar'> <li><a href='2011-10-01.html' title='2011-10-01'>Food, glorious food.</a></li> <li><a href='2011-09-25.html' title='2011-09-25'>Tokyo.</a></li> <li><a href='2011-09-22.html' title='2011-09-22'>An Interesting 3 Days</a></li> </ul> <script type='text/javascript'> var anchors = document.getElementsByTagName("A"); for (var i = 0; i<anchors.length; i++) if (anchors[i].href.indexOf(document.body.getAttribute("data-page")) != -1) anchors[i].className += " currentpage "; </script> </body> </html>
