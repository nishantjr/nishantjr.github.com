Part of the park is thickly wooded (in the middle of Tokyo) and has a shrine in it. The other part is a sort of picnic spot for hundreds and hundreds of people. There are a whole bunch of people practicing hoola-hoop, juggling, tricks with a football, band practice (lot of jazzy sounding stuff) walking the dog or just having a picnic and drinking a beer. We went to an indian fete(Interestingly my stomache was upset when I got home); there were japanese girls bollywood-dancing in Saris. Went to Takeshita Street (Tokyo's Fashion street). Did the laundry or the first time.</p> <div class="fb-comments" data-href="nishantjr.github.com/2011-09-25.html"></div> </div> </body> </html>
