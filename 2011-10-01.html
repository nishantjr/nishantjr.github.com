<h1>Food, glorious food.</h1>
<p>Went with Tomo and his friend Yoshisa to a place called &#39;Na Be Zo&#39; for the first real
japanese meal. We ate Sukiyaki.</p>

<pre><code>    // thank you google for telling me the name
</code></pre>

<p>There&#39;s a bowl of hot soupish/oilish/something on a stove in the middle of the table.
There&#39;s a stack or trays filled with pork and beef (slooooooberrrrr) on one side.
And there&#39;s 3 pots of (spicey by tokyo-standards)&#39;s/sauses.
Pork. Chopstick. Boil. Spam sauce. Eat. Repeat-for-two-hours.</p>

<p>Yes, two hours. Eat as much as you can in two hours.
Though there we took breaks to drink. And order more.
Heaven.</p>

<p>They also tought us some Japanese:</p>

<p>&quot;Anata wa kawaii desu&quot;  </p>

<pre><code>    // translations would give you a hint about the waitress.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;ii ne&quot;</p>

<p>And the rest got drown in sake.</p>

<p>Thennnnn today.
Went to a second hand cycle-shop suggested by Huw. Chose a cycle.
Chose a head lamp. Got a lock. Took the money out. 
Couldnt spell my name in Katakana (one of the japanese scripts), so I couldnt register.
Came home.
It was Tom&#39;s (alice&#39;s brother&#39;s birthday). Skylar had done the cooking.
Great stuff... Takoyaki - way better than the road side stuff we had on one of the 
first days here.</p>

<p>Skylar then took me for a cycle ride. So a decent amount of Ota-ku (where i stay)
nd the surrundings. Bars, clubs and brothels. Cheap super markets 
and the video game parlours.
To bed then! 2:46 AM</p>

<p>So much to do and so few hours in a day. Tokyo, ii ne!</p>
