We ate (thank you google for telling me the name) Sukiyaki There's a bowl of hot soupish/oilish/something on a stove in the middle of the table. There's a stack or trays filled with pork and beef (slooooooberrrrr) on one side. And there's 3 pots of (spicey by tokyo-standards)'s/sauses. Pork. Chopstick. Boil. Spam sauce. Eat. Repeat-for-two-hours.</p> <p>Yes, two hours. Eat as much as you can in two hours. Though there we took breaks to drink. And order more. Heaven.</p> <p>They also tought us some Japanese:</p> <p>"Anata wa kawaii desu" </p> <pre><code> // translations would give you a hint about the waitress. </code></pre> <p>"ii ne"</p> <p>And the rest got drown in sake.</p> <p>Thennnnn today. Went to a second hand cycle-shop suggested by Huw. Chose a cycle. Chose a head lamp. Got a lock. Took the money out. Couldnt spell my name in Katakana (one of the japanese scripts), so I couldnt register. Came home. It was Tom's (alice's brother's birthday). Skylar had done the cooking. Great stuff... Takoyaki - way better than the road side stuff we had on one of the first days here.</p> <p>Skylar then took me for a cycle ride. So a decent amount of Ota-ku (where i stay) nd the surrundings. Bars, clubs and sex-shops. Cheap super markets and the video game parlours. To bed then! 2:46 AM</p> <p>So much to do and so few hours in a day. Tokyo, ii ne!</p> <div class="fb-comments" data-href="nishantjr.github.com/2011-10-01.html"></div> </div> </body> </html>
