I'm making this blog to document my escapades, teach myself writing, practice
building web-sites, show off my doodles, try my hand at design and more
importantly - to have fun.

I try to do as much is reasonable by hand - HTML, CSS, the drawings and images
to let me appreciate the effort that goes into doing these things. I had started
off trying to write my own static site generator, and got it working too, but
[jekyll] is so much nicer, so I'm going with that now.

I've been writing about the various (mis-)adventures I've been having - [nearly
getting arrested for stealing my own bicycle]({% post_url 2011-12-10-yamanote-madness %}),
 a rained-on attempt at [climbing Mt. Fuji]({% post_url 2012-09-15-fuji-san %}) or
[bicycle rides]({% post_url 2015-10-04-kashmir-and-ladhak-2 %}).

So share and enjoy!
