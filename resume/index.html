<p>As a developer, I'm proponent of test-driven development and a firm believer of
"Continual Improvement" - every time you touch a piece of code, you leave it
better than it was before. I think it's important to have an intimate knowledge
of the tools you work with, and find the time to delve into the workings and
design decisions taken in the platforms, languages and runtimes that I use. It's
important to me to have both breadth of knowledge as well as depth and I make it
a point to learn at least a little about important and popular technology and
tools even if I don't use them myself.
