Jullay! Laddakh by cycle
========================

One mid august Sunday I get a call from Saahil asking if I want to get Leh -
but I have to decide in half an hour. What the hell - yes - I've wanted to go
there for the last 3 years. Very reasonable rates Rs 7500, more or less
everything provided by the [YHAI](yhaindia.org).

Except.

Fun stuff like getting a GRE date. Anyway somehow pull that off - get the best
possible date, one day before the trip.

Finish GRE. Half dead the next day, but have to work. Then realize flight was
one day before I thought it was - start packing 3 hours before the flight
(thanks Mum, Dad, Deej). Fly Mumbai - Raipur - Bhopal - Delhi - Leh. I've been
on trains with less stops.

Reach Leh, take a cab to the YHAI place - Jimmy House. After registering, we're
told to sit around and sleep the whole day at the house with the black gate -
nothing strenuous like climbing onto the terrace and taking pictures or
anything ;).

Next day we walk around Leh, eat ladhaki Khari biscuits, buy dubba's for packed
lunch check out the Leh market, all that. Introduced to the people from outside
our group of 6 in the room. Met the bicycles - trek 3700s. Very climbing
oriented gearing. Soup. Dinner. Bournevita. Sleep.

Next day we did a cycle around to an Army museum called the Hall of Fame museum
- they had decent chai. Went to Spittuk monastery - brilliant (read: typical
ladakhi) view. Chai, packed lunch and back - only this time uphill. Saahil and
I were selected as the rear guard with the green flag, keep the cycle kit with
us. Soup. Dinner.  Bournevita. Campfire (without the fire). Sleep.

So finally, the next day leave on the real trip. Cycle
