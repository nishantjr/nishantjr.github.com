::: post-narrative
On the way from Ladhak to Srinagar (by taxi) on our [previous cycle trip to
Ladhak](/blog/2013/09/13/jullay/), Saahil casually suggested doing a
cycle ride from Srinagar to Leh. Two years later, we finally got down to it -
and it turned into quite an adventure. This is a continuation of [part
1](/blog/2015/10/03/kashmir-and-ladhak-1/).
:::

We left the warm comfort of the tents at 10 the next morning, wearing slippers
since our shoes had frozen solid! The roads were downhill, but quite damaged by
the winter ice. We patched 5-6 punctures that day, reaching Dras (height 3230m)
around 5pm completing just the distance we had intended to complete the previous
day. In Dras, we had our first taste of Wazwan with the Rogan Josh from the
place across the hotel. We ate, showered and fell asleep, exhausted, by 9:30.

Leaving at a late 10:30 again the next day, we met another pair of cyclists -
Amit and Binoy, who had started the day after we left Srinagar. They'd made it
from Sonamarg to Dras over the Zoji La in a day! The road from Dras started of
quite bad and had us afraid of punctures but quickly got better and quite fun.
We'd even set up the Garmin camera, though it ran out of space in a few hours.

Reached Kargil (height 2676m) at 2:30 and after a bit of confusion about gadi
walas and watch repair men, got brake pads replaced and tubes fixed (our patches
weren't staying on for too long for some reason - and we were a bit fed up of
doing it ourselves) and ate lunch with Amit and Binoy. We decided to stay the
evening in Kargil and rest for a bit. Ate 'tagger'/'tiger' kebabs and some more
Wazwan. 

At Kargil, we'd decided to start being more careful about timings and food - the
last 3 days we'd cycled until we'd had almost no energy. We left the hotel by
830 and were on our way a little past 9. We started off with a puncture and bad
roads but made good time to Mulbhek (height 3304m), reaching there by 2:30.
Quickly losing interest in the Buddha statue carved into the rock, we found a
restaurant. Lunch and 3 cups of chai later, we enquired about guest houses.
Nobody was too sure, but there was a vague idea of a place 10km past the Namik
La pass (height 3700m) 20km ahead.  It was quite a steep climb up to Namik La
but the lunch done its job and we reached the top by 5:30, Saahil seeing
snowfall for the first time. The snow and wind had gotten quite serious at the
top so we pushed of quickly down the sweet sweet downhill, stopping for chai and
directions at Khangral. After unfreezing our fingers we head down 5km ahead to a
guest house at Bod-Kharbu. Find the Guest house but turns out that there's no
one there. Eat maggi and omelette for dinner again, and are taken to a homestay.
And of course, we clean our bikes have baths and a shave ummm... /s

Left Kharbu by 9 and had eaten two breakfasts by 10: coffee and omelettes at the
Marathi Army Cafe - they serve wada pav, but we went too early; and fresh
heavenly carb-filled aloo parathas. We climbed Fotula Top (height 4108m)
around 2, and reached Lamayuru soon after. On the last trip we'd Fotula was the
farthest point, so this was all known ground. We ate at one of the guest houses
we'd stayed at 2 years ago. Passing Khaltse, our planned stop for the night, we
pushed on to Nurla (height 3041m). At Nurla, the (extremely pretty) resort
we'd stayed at the last time was booked full, and the only other place in town
was Rs 6000 a night, but we managed to find a very comfortable homestay.

From Nurla to Leh (height 3524m) was quite uneventful, eating at Basgo,
ignoring magnetic hill, tea at [Pathar Sahib Gurudvara]. The road of evil,
christened 2 years ago was an extremely long uphill with a bad headwind and
dwindling supply of water. It was now sweet sweet downhill, possibly the fastest
road on the whole trip, until the hall of fame museum. We stopped for a second
tea here, and finally made it to Leh at 7, found a hotel and celebrated by
complaining about the WiFi.

The next day we didn't see our cycles - and we didn't miss them. Arranged a car
and walked around Leh a bit. Our driver was quite interesting - he showed up at
3 AM an hour and a half before we were supposed to leave, because he hadn't read
the time right (though that turned out to be a good thing). We reached Dras
half an hour after the road to Zojila closed, but he sweet talked the guard to
let us through. We took some vegetables for Sarjar, and reached Srinagar around
5 - watching 7 days of cycling unwind in 12 hours.

Spent the next day around Srinagar sampling the Wazwan and shopping, and headed
home on the big jet plane.
