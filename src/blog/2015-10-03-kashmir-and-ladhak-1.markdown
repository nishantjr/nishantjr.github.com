::: post-narrative
On the way from Ladhak to Srinagar (by taxi) on our [previous cycle trip to
Ladhak](/blog/2013/09/13/jullay/), Saahil casually suggested doing a
cycle ride from Srinagar to Leh. Two years later, we finally got down to it -
and it turned into quite an adventure.
:::

Checked in to "Lonely Guest House" in Srinagar, and quickly made friends with
Aijas, the owner. Drank kawah[^1] and unpacked our bikes. He gave us space to
keep the bike boxes and showed us the way to the nearest Punjabi dhaba[^2]
(chicken so fresh there was blood on the walls).

At the restaurant, people encouraged us: "You'll never reach! On the way to
Zoji La, there are potholes I can swim in." "Whoever suggested that you go on
this trip were trying to kill you;"  "Sure, go ahead, just take a truck from
Sonamarg to Zoji La."

Left the guest house that morning at eight, bought water and pedals. Finally
oriented ourselves and were heading out of Srinagar (height 1600m) by ten.
Rode halfway around the Dal Lake to reach the highway. We celebrated the first
23 km with a second breakfast and the mixing of the electrolytes.

Saahil's rear rack gave a bit of trouble (this was the first time we were
testing fully loaded) and we had to flip around the bolt so it wouldn't get into
the gears---and have our first tea break. Yes, tea and food feature a lot in
this adventure. Forty kilometers, a breakfast and tea-break in 3 hours: this is
too easy. All you nay-sayers: we laugh at you.

By late afternoon, we've started climbing quite a bit, we eat lunch at a kebab
place - the first of many oily omelettes. And again an hour and a half later for
salty Bajiyas and Kawah. We've finished about 70 km now---not counting the first
hour in Srinagar---and are quite tired. Locals claim the distance to Sonamarg are
anything between "over the next hill" and 30 km ahead. As it gets dark, and the
wind picks up and boy does it pick up (A headwind, of course. Tailwinds don't
get noticed). They say we'll never make it. We decide to call it a day at the
next hotel we find and settle in for dinner at a place 15 km before Sonamarg.
Sleeping soundly with the sweet knowledge that there's just 20 km of climbing and
40 km of downhill scheduled for the next day.

We leave around 10:30 the next day after a staple oily omelette breakfast and
head out towards Zojila. Cycling the gradual ascent to Sonamarg (height 2800m),
we reach there in time for an early lunch not sure when the next stop will
be. As we go ahead, the ascent becomes steeper, the two-lane highway turns into
one-lane, and as trucks stop to give their engines a break, not even that. The
road is completely destroyed by the glaciers that covered the road in winter.
Walls of ice on either side, some 2-3 stories high. There's not a chai wala in
sight.  Looking at the road ahead - you can see it winding it's way clinging to
the side of the mountains far far ahead - we wonder where the pass is. Finally
we're told we're nearing the top, the road is a narrow gully between the ice -
more of a stream than a road really. We reach smooth paver block-ed section and
a god sent chai-shop. The chai shop is a tent sitting on top of 2 feet of ice.
We're told we're at zero-point (height 3528m). We've made it. The 20 km had
turned into 40 km; it took us 7 hours to do what we thought we'd take 3-4 hours
to do.

It was 6 in the evening and the Kashmir chai walas told us we wouldn't make it
to Drass, 40 km ahead. This time we believed them. They said we could either put
our cycles in a truck and go down to Drass, or sleep over in the tents with
them. We decided to stay up at the pass.

Sarjar and his companions fed us and gave us Kawah. They gave us a Phiran
(long Kashmiri kurtas) and Kagri (cane baskets holding burning coal in clay
pots) each and put the coal-burning pots inside the Phiran! So warm! An hour
later we were quite warm, and truck drivers wire telling us nonsensical ghost
stories. We slept under five layers of blankets with a Kangri to warm us up and
woke up warm and refreshed.  Sarjar and Co. took us for a bit of sled-riding in
the morning too.

We were extremely lucky---Sarjar had just come the previous day to set up shop.
It had snowed quite heavily too---a couple of feet of snow---but was bright and
sunny when we got there. Sarjar and his friends came from a village not far
from Srinagar and have been setting up this tea stall at the top of the pass for
the last 4-5 years. They stay at the zero-point taking turns to return for
supplies every 2 weeks.

We left the warm comfort of the tents at 10 the next morning, wearing slippers
since our shoes had frozen solid! The roads were downhill, but quite damaged by
the winter ice. We patched 5-6 punctures that day, reaching Dras (height 3230m)
around 5pm completing just the distance we had intended to complete the previous
day. In Dras, we had our first taste of Wazwan with the Rogan Josh from the
place across the hotel. We ate, showered and fell asleep, exhausted, by 9:30.

Leaving at a late 10:30 again the next day, we met another pair of cyclists -
Amit and Binoy, who had started the day after we left Srinagar. They'd made it
from Sonamarg to Dras over the Zoji La in a day! The road from Dras started of
quite bad and had us afraid of punctures but quickly got better and quite fun.
We'd even set up the Garmin camera, though it ran out of space in a few hours.

Reached Kargil (height 2676m) at 2:30 and after a bit of confusion about gadi
walas and watch repair men, got brake pads replaced and tubes fixed (our patches
weren't staying on for too long for some reason - and we were a bit fed up of
doing it ourselves) and ate lunch with Amit and Binoy. We decided to stay the
evening in Kargil and rest for a bit. Ate 'tagger'/'tiger' kebabs and some more
Wazwan. 

At Kargil, we'd decided to start being more careful about timings and food - the
last 3 days we'd cycled until we'd had almost no energy. We left the hotel by
830 and were on our way a little past 9. We started off with a puncture and bad
roads but made good time to Mulbhek (height 3304m), reaching there by 2:30.
Quickly losing interest in the Buddha statue carved into the rock, we found a
restaurant. Lunch and 3 cups of chai later, we enquired about guest houses.
Nobody was too sure, but there was a vague idea of a place 10km past the Namik
La pass (height 3700m) 20km ahead.  It was quite a steep climb up to Namik La
but the lunch done its job and we reached the top by 5:30, Saahil seeing
snowfall for the first time. The snow and wind had gotten quite serious at the
top so we pushed of quickly down the sweet sweet downhill, stopping for chai and
directions at Khangral. After unfreezing our fingers we head down 5km ahead to a
guest house at Bod-Kharbu. Find the Guest house but turns out that there's no
one there. Eat maggi and omelette for dinner again, and are taken to a homestay.
And of course, we clean our bikes have baths and a shave ummm... /s

Left Kharbu by 9 and had eaten two breakfasts by 10: coffee and omelettes at the
Marathi Army Cafe - they serve wada pav, but we went too early; and fresh
heavenly carb-filled aloo parathas. We climbed Fotula Top (height 4108m)
around 2, and reached Lamayuru soon after. On the last trip we'd Fotula was the
farthest point, so this was all known ground. We ate at one of the guest houses
we'd stayed at 2 years ago. Passing Khaltse, our planned stop for the night, we
pushed on to Nurla (height 3041m). At Nurla, the (extremely pretty) resort
we'd stayed at the last time was booked full, and the only other place in town
was Rs 6000 a night, but we managed to find a very comfortable homestay.

From Nurla to Leh (height 3524m) was quite uneventful, eating at Basgo,
ignoring magnetic hill, tea at [Pathar Sahib Gurudvara]. The road of evil,
christened 2 years ago was an extremely long uphill with a bad headwind and
dwindling supply of water. It was now sweet sweet downhill, possibly the fastest
road on the whole trip, until the hall of fame museum. We stopped for a second
tea here, and finally made it to Leh at 7, found a hotel and celebrated by
complaining about the WiFi.

The next day we didn't see our cycles - and we didn't miss them. Arranged a car
and walked around Leh a bit. Our driver was quite interesting - he showed up at
3 AM an hour and a half before we were supposed to leave, because he hadn't read
the time right (though that turned out to be a good thing). We reached Dras
half an hour after the road to Zojila closed, but he sweet talked the guard to
let us through. We took some vegetables for Sarjar, and reached Srinagar around
5 - watching 7 days of cycling unwind in 12 hours.

Spent the next day around Srinagar sampling the Wazwan and shopping, and headed
home on the big jet plane.
