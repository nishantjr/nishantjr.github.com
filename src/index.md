I'm making this blog to document my escapades, teach myself writing, practice
building websites, show off my doodles, try my hand at design and &ndash; most
importantly &ndash; to have fun.

I try to do as much is reasonable by hand, from the writing and illustration to
the design, HTML and CSS. This lets me appreciate the effort that goes in to the
pre-made packages that most people use for many of these things. I had even
written my own static site generator and run this site on it, but [Jekyll]
turned out to be much nicer, so I converted to that (for the moment).

I've been writing about the various (mis-)adventures I've been having - [nearly
getting arrested for stealing my own bicycle](/blog/2011/12/10/yamanote-madness),
 a rained-on attempt at [climbing Mt. Fuji](/blog/2012/09/15/fuji-san) or
[bicycle rides](/blog/2015/10/04/kashmir-and-ladhak-2).

So share and enjoy!
