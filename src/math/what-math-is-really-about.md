When I mention that I'm doing my masters in math, people immediately compain
that they hate math in School, and go on to ask me multiply large numbers.

But that's not what math is about. I too hate arithmetic. I'm dyslexic, I'm
aweful with numbers, and I jokingly (but not really) say that I took higher
level math specifically to escape dealing with numbers -- the more advanced
math you do the less actual numbers you deal with.


So what is math really, then?

* Infinite hotel to explain countable infinity and adding and multiplying it,
  then go on to explain Cantors Diagonal argument (i.e. why some infinities
  are larger than others)

* Explain Group theory as a more abstract, and not obviously related to numbers
